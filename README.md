## CS140e, Winter 2026

We're currently accepting applications for winter 2026:
 - [https://forms.gle/4R16Q3bspV5acwAm8](https://forms.gle/4R16Q3bspV5acwAm8)

We'll have rolling acceptances, currently aiming for the first set a
week after the quarter ends, but will be reviewing apps til class starts.

The 2025 repo is [here](https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-25win) if you
want to look at the old materials.  There should be some significant
improvements this year, but tbd.

Note: the application doesn't make this clear, but note: PhD students from
other depts are definitely welcome!
