## Overview

**Goal**: control the pins on the pi by writing your own bare-metal
GPIO driver using the raw Broadcom BCM2835 datasheet. A cornerstone
of this class is learning how to understand and act on datasheets.
This is our first "hello world" example: short, but representative.

**What you'll build**:
- `gpio_set_input(pin)/output(pin)` - Configure pins for input/output.
- `gpio_set_on(pin)/off(pin)` - Turn output pins on (3.3V) or off (0V).
- `gpio_read(pin)` - Read input pins: returns 0 or 1 based on
   input voltage level.
- Various LED blink programs using your driver.

**Prerequisites**:
- Read [PRELAB.md](PRELAB.md) before starting
- Complete [Lab 0: Pi Setup](../0-pi-setup/README.md)

**Required readings**:
- Broadcom BCM2835 manual: [../../docs/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.annot.PDF](../../docs/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.annot.PDF) - you cannot do the lab without this. Defines device addresses, values, and rules.
- [BCM2835 GPIO errata](https://elinux.org/BCM2835_datasheet_errata#p90) - Known BCM2835 bugs.
- [GPIO notes](../../notes/devices/GPIO.md) - How GPIO works.
- [DEVICE notes](../../notes/devices/DEVICES.md) - Common device hardware patterns.

**Read the code/ (10 minutes)**
- **Goal**: Understand there's no hidden magic in the system.
- All code for this lab is in `code/` (except bootloader, which you'll
  write in Lab 6). Look through:
  - `start.S` - boot assembly that sets up stack and calls C code
  - `Makefile` (heavily commented).  After you run make:
  - `.list` files - disassembly showing what actually runs
  - Memory layout: the code addresses come from `memmap`
     and correspond to the address in `config.txt`.

#### Checkoff

No autograder today: demo working tests to TA.  We will check: 
  - Does: `3-loopback.bin work.
  - Does your own `5-all.bin` work.
  - Does your `gpio.c` make sense and exmplify simplicy.

Unfortunately, due to the size of the class this year we won't be able to give
you debugging help during checkoff if there are others waiting.

**Extensions**: See end of README for sonar sensor and other bonus work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 0. Make sure your LED + pi hardware works.

**For eternity (and the rest of the quarter):** Always test hardware
before writing code. Otherwise you waste time not knowing if bugs are
in software, hardware, or (worse) both.

This isn't the first time you've deliberately solved for one variable
at a time!  Very old technique, so don't forget what you know because
you're in a new domain:
1. **As you learned in maths**: solving one variable at a time makes
   problems solvable at all, and ensures you solve for the right variable.
   - LOL: Debugging software when hardware is broken.
   - LOL: Debugging hardware when software is broken.
   - LOL: Debugging at all when both are broken.
2. **Break problems into pieces**: The smaller the piece, the easier
   to isolate its problem(s).
3. **Differential debugging**: Swap pieces to find not-working.
   Binary search is great, but even linear substitution beats
   solving two variables at once.
4. **Class pro-tip**: We always provide pre-built `staff-binaries/*.bin`
   to test hardware independently. Use them! (Want harder mode? Ignore these.)


### Quick LED Test

Test your LED works by connecting directly to 3.3V (not 5V!) power, no code
needed:

1. Connect LED to ground and **briefly** touch other leg to 3.3V pin
  - **WARNING**: Again: Use 3.3V, NOT 5V!  (Written on board.)
  - EE folks: 
    - We don't use a breadboard b/c it's bulky.
    - We don't use resistors for the same reason + the 10mm LED is 
      big enough we (generally) don't fry it.
  - **SAFETY**: since these are farm-fresh LEDs from overseas don't
    put your eye right next to them in case they were made by maniacs
    and explode.
2. **LED doesn't light?**
   - Reverse the LED (longer leg = power, shorter = ground)
   - Try partner's working LED on your pi
   - Try your LED on partner's pi
   - Try different LED
   - If still broken → ask staff
3.  **Wire colors** (strongly recommended):
   - Red = power (3.3V)
   - Black = ground
   - Colors don't affect electricity, but make debugging much easier

**Power cycling**: For today only, you must power-cycle the pi (push the
metal Parthiv-board button or unplug the USB cable) after each test.
- Why: we don't have a reboot yet. If you look at `code/start.S`, which
  calls into our C code, you'll see it infinite loops on exit.
- If bootloader errors occur, this is usually why.
- (Fixed in later labs)

**Mac users**: If `<string.h>` errors mention MacSDK, run `export CPATH=`
in your shell and see if that fixes it. (If so: You can add to `~/.zshrc` 
to make permanent.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 1: make GPIO output work  (`1-blink.bin`, `2-blink.bin`)

**Files**: `1-blink.bin`, `2-blink.bin`

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect LED to pin 20 + ground. Both are labeled on the Parthiv-board.
2. Test: `pi-install staff-binaries/1-blink.bin` → LED should blink
4. Test: `pi-install staff-binaries/2-blink.bin` → LED and 
   Parthive on-board LED should blink oppositely.

### Implementation

Edit `code/gpio.c` to implement:

| Function | Purpose | Complexity |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `gpio_set_output(pin)` | Configure pin as output | ~10 lines |
| `gpio_set_on(pin)` | Turn pin on (set high) | ~5 lines |
| `gpio_set_off(pin)` | Turn pin off (set low) | ~5 lines |

**Datasheet reference**: BCM2835 manual, GPIO section (pages 89-101)

See [HINTS.md](HINTS.md) for implementation guidance.

### Testing

After implementation, test both programs:

**Test 1 - Single LED**:
```bash
# Power-cycle pi (parthiv button)
pi-install code/1-blink.bin
# Pin 20 LED should blink
```

**Test 2 - Two LEDs**:
```bash
# Power-cycle pi
pi-install code/2-blink.bin
# Pins 20's led and 27 (parthiv led) should blink in opposite phase
```

### Troubleshooting

**Tests fail but staff binary works?**
- Check jumper connections (may have come loose)
- Verify LED polarity
- Try staff binary again to isolate software vs hardware

**Both fail?**
- Hardware issue - recheck Part 0

See [HINTS.md](HINTS.md) for more debugging tips.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 2: GPIO Input (`3-loopback.bin`)

**New capability**: In part 1 you did output, now you'll do input.
Between the two you can control a surprising number of digital devices
you can buy on eBay, Adafruit, Sparkfun, Alibaba, etc.

**1. `gpio_set_input(pin)` - Configure pin as input**
- Few lines of code, similar to `gpio_set_output`
- **CRITICAL**: Use read-modify-write for `FSEL` register
  - Don't overwrite other pin configurations in the same FSEL register.
  - Bug may not appear today but will break multi-device programs later.

**2. `gpio_read(pin)` - Read pin value**
- Must return ONLY `0` or `1` (not arbitrary positive integers)
- Must mask out other pins' values
- Verify using bitwise operations

### Hardware Setup - Loopback Test

We'll test input without external devices using a "loopback jumper" 
(common trick):
1. **SETUP**: Connect jumper from pin 9 (output) to pin 8 (input).
2. Code writes to pin 9, reads from pin 10.
3. Since we don't have `printf` yet, `3-loopback.bin` makes the system's
   state externally visible by turning LEDs on/off based on what pin
   10 reads.

```bash
# Power-cycle pi
pi-install code/3-loopback.bin
# Both LEDs should turn on/off simultaneously
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Part 3: write your own tests.

1. **act led***

The rpi has an on-board LED accessed by setting GPIO pin 47.  It's
useful as a status indicator since it's built-in.  It's also useful
as a check that you can access higher GPIO bank.
 1. Write a program that will blink the act led.
 2. Modify the Makefile so it compiles. 
    understand.
 3. Compile and run it!

2. **Complete test***

As the final test:
 1. Write another test that blinks all three LEDs at the same time. 
    This makes it easy to see that everything is working.
 2. You'll have to modify the Makefile again to add the new test.
 3. Compile and run it!

Congratulations!  At this point you can checkoff.

If you finish early, and get tired of helping other people,
we encourage you to do the
[first device extension, sonar](../extensions-device/1-sonar/README.md).

There are additional extensions in [the extensions doc](EXTENSIONS.md).
