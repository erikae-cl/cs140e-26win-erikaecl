## The labs

Below describes where we're going and why.   The labs themselves have a
lot more prose on each topic.  There is a pointer to where we currently
are: the labs after this point can still see significant revisions.
   - [Last year's summary of what we did](https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-25win/blob/main/labs/what-did-we-learn.md) might be a useful breakdown of where this is all going.

### 0: non-pi hacking

Unlike all subsequent labs, our first two don't use hardware.  They should
give a good feel for whether the class works for you without requiring
a hardware investment.

  - [0-intro](0-intro): the intro (non-lab) lecture.

  - [1-trusting-trust](1-trusting-trust): Ken Thompson is
    our patron saint of operating systems --- brilliant, with a gift
    for simple code that did powerful things.   We will reimplement a
    simplified version of a crazy hack he described in his Turing award
    lecture that let him log into any Unix system in a way hidden even
    from careful code inspection.
